# Airplane-fare-prediction

This project focuses on predicting airplane ticket fares using machine learning models. The goal is to identify the key factors influencing airfare and build reliable predictive models to estimate prices accurately.

Project Overview

The dataset was analyzed to uncover patterns in flight fares based on features such as airline, source, destination, route, total stops, and departure time. After extensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis, multiple models were built and evaluated to determine the best-performing one.

Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Performed data cleaning, missing value imputation, and outlier handling.

* Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify patterns and correlations.

* Visualized relationships between fare and key attributes such as airline and journey duration.

2. Statistical Analysis & Feature Engineering:

* Assessed feature importance using correlation analysis and statistical tests.

* Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

* Removed multicollinearity and redundant predictors.

3. Model Building & Evaluation:

* Implemented and compared multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

* Evaluated models using RMSE and RÂ² scores.

* Ranked models in ascending order of RMSE for best performance insights.

4. Result Interpretation:

* Highlighted the model with the lowest RMSE as the most accurate for fare prediction.

* Discussed practical implications for pricing strategies and operational efficiency.

Key Insights

* Fare variation is strongly influenced by airline type, stops, and journey duration.

* Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) performed better than simple regression methods.

Feature optimization and outlier management significantly improved prediction accuracy.
